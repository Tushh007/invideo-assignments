# Simple Online Graphics Design Platform

## Goal

The goal of this assignment is to build a simple online image editing tool with basic functionalities.

## Description

Candidate needs to build a very simple image editing tool using canvas that let user add one / more image templates to the canvas, modify it and the save the generated design. For inspiration user can check some of the existing online graphics design tools like [Canva](https://canva.com).

## Features

- A panel that loads thumbnails from [Picsum](https://picsum.photos/v2/list) with pagination on scrolling.

- A blank canvas (9:16)

- A feature that lets you fit an image with different aspect ratio than the canvas by blurring the sides. Check out the [example](https://github.com/invideoio/invideo-assignments/blob/master/frontend/example.mp4) to get better idea.

## Bonus Features
- Let user drag one or more image templates from the panel to the canvas.

- Switch aspect ratio of canvas to 16:9

- Cropping the image

- Support adding a text box which can be rotated, scaled

- Any other image editing feature you might want to show


## Deliverables

This is a fairly challenging task, so we are not expecting a full fledged solution. Rather our expectations are a working solution that can execute the above mentioned features. We would love if you can document your assumptions, the features that it supports and some thoughts on what are the major challenges to develop a full fledge solution and how you think you will approach it.

- A typescript project that runs the app on localhost. The requirement for this task is to implement the central canvas / editing area using the canvas api.

- Readme file to let us know how to run the app and any other documentation that you might want to share

## Instructions

- One of the key challenges of this assignment is identifying how to work with canvas api. You are allowed to use any libraries.

- Must use typescript.

- A well written code with good abstractions will definitely make the project more appealing

- Good Design / UI is not important but definitely has bonus points

- This will be followed by an interview where you will be asked to explain your decisions and asked to describe about challenges and opportunities with your solution

- Please ask questions. Its ok to have doubts and we are eager to answer those.

- Most importantly, have fun building it :) :)
